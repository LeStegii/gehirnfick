A simple interpreter for the [Brainfuck](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) programming language.

### What is Brainfuck?
[Brainfuck](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric programming language. This means that although it is Turing-complete, it is not used for real programs, but mainly for fun.

### Ok, why?
Just because. I wanted to write a simple compiler/interpreter for a while now and thought this would be a good start.
